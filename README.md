# week-1-challenge
I change all div to section for accessibility reasons.
I Finally fixed the picture of the meeting to look like the example because it changed somehow after i did the change from div to section
basically to fix that i doubled the values and played with the numbers on live server until it was reasonably matched
I cleaned the css and removed the redundancies
I added all the alt attributes 
I made sure that the heading attributes are in sequential order
I added a title that tells the navigator the type of the website.
